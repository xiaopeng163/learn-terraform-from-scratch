Remote State S3
==================

This is a remote state that can be used to store and retrieve data from an S3 bucket.

For more details, visit the `Terraform S3 Backend Documentation <https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3>`_.

Example Usage
-------------

Below is an example of how to configure the Terraform backend to use an S3 bucket for storing state:

.. code-block:: hcl

   terraform {
     backend "s3" {
       bucket = "mybucket"
       key    = "path/to/my/key"
       region = "us-east-1"
     }
   }
